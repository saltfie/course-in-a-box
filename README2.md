#### A brief reflection explaining how git and github support this project.

I have experience creating rudimentary websites using HTML, web templates, Wordpress, and Drupal, so in many ways, this project had enough overlap and similarities with these tools that I felt pretty comfortable with using GitHub in creating a site. The features I especially liked were the commit messages, history, issues, and projects. Keeping track of changes is really useful, both in what changes were made and when. The interaction between the issues, commits, and project board is also very helpful for project management. I can see how these tools would be indispensable when there are multiple collaborators.

GitHub Pages was the biggest surprise to me, and it opened my eyes to functionalities in GitHub that I didn't know existed. I do find it amazing that we can create websites this way, and that there are a lot of tools out there that work well with it-- Jekyll, Bookdown, Course-in-a-Box, and others.

Making my own Course-in-a-Box project made Git and GitHub seem much less intimidating to me. I still feel a little uncomfortable with some of the Git commands, such as branch and revert, but it's good to know that I do feel comfortable with other parts. I hope that I will someday have a chance to apply what I've learned at my job.
