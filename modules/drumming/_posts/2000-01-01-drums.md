Don't have a drum? Not a problem. Many a taiko player has started by hitting on makeshift drums. And for drumsticks (called bachi), people have made these out of wooden broom handles and thin rolling pins!

Chung-wan Choi has devoted a website to making drums out of material from hardware stores at <a href="https://diytaiko.com/" target="_blank">DIY Taiko</a>.

In this video, Katsuji Asano from <a href="https://asano.us/" target="_blank">Asano Taiko US</a> shows how to make a taiko from a tire. The list of materials can be found <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/latixcovid-19/resources/tire-drum" target="_blank">here</a>.
