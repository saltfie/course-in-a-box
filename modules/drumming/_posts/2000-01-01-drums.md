Don't have a drum? Not a problem. Many a taiko player has started by hitting on makeshift drums. And for drumsticks (called bachi), people have made these out of wooden broom handles and thin rolling pins!

Chung-wan Choi has devoted a website to making drums out of material from hardware stores at [DIY Taiko](https://diytaiko.com/).

In this video, Katsuji Asano from [Asano Taiko US](https://asano.us/) shows how to make a taiko from a tire. The list of materials can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/latixcovid-19/resources/tire-drum).
